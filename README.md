# FSD-TrainScheduler
Full Stack Developer project: I created a train schedule application that uses Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The application retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. The website provides up-to-date information about various trains such as their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
